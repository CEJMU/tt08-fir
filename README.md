# Tiny Tapeout FIR-Filter Example presented at SDRA 2025 in Friedrichshafen, Germany

- [Read the slides for the talk project](docs/slides.pdf)

## Abstract:

Initiatives such as Google Skywater, IHP130, and Tiny Tapeout, coupled with the
collaboration of open-source tools like OpenRoad/OpenLane or Yosys, are poised
to democratize chip design. This approach eliminates the need for commercial EDA
tools, making the production of custom chips using multi-project wafers and
chips significantly more affordable â€“ even for hobbyists. This presentation will
elucidate the intricacies of such a workflow, from the design level entry using
system Verilog to the generation  of GDS-II files. Additionally, it will present
examples and ideas, initiating a discussion on potential future applications,
particularly in the realm of ham radio.

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.
